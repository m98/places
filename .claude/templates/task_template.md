## Always Remember
- **Document changes** - After successful verification:
    - Write a brief, conceptual summary of changes made
    - Focus on the "what" and "why" rather than technical implementation details
    - Save this summary as `implementation_summary.md` in the same directory as the task file
    - This serves as a memory blueprint for future development cycles
- Store task-related documentation (`execution_plan.md`, `implementation_summary.md`) alongside task files
