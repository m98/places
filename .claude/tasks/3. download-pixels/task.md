## What & Why
- **Feature/Task:** Allow users to download the drawing they see in the canvas as PNG files
- **Problem/Goal:** Users should be able to download and save their canvas artwork locally
- **In scope:** Create /download API endpoint that calls /live API and generates PNG for download
- **Out of scope:** Testing implementation (will be added later)

## Interfaces & Dependencies
- **APIs / schemas / migrations:** Create new /download API endpoint that calls existing /live API to generate downloadable PNG
- **Env/Secrets/Flags:** None required
- Packages to install: Any library needed for PNG generation (to be determined during implementation)

## Success Criteria (Definition of Done)
- [x] User can click a download button and receive a PNG file of their canvas
- [x] Meets metrics: PNG file accurately represents the current canvas state

## Acceptance Tests (examples)
- **Case 1:** Given a canvas with pixel art, When user clicks the download button (Lucid download icon) in the toolbar, Then a PNG file of the canvas is downloaded to their device
- **Edge cases:** Empty canvas, very large canvas with many pixels, network connectivity issues during download
- **Negative cases:** API failure should show user-friendly error message, invalid canvas data should be handled gracefully

## Examples to Imitate
- To be determined during implementation based on existing codebase patterns

## Documentation to Use
- Local links: None required
- Notes (sections to follow): Follow existing codebase patterns

## Other Considerations
- Use Lucid icon for download button in toolbar
- Ensure PNG generation maintains pixel-perfect accuracy of canvas
- Follow existing UI/UX patterns for toolbar buttons

## Always Remember
- **Document changes** - After successful verification:
    - Write a brief, conceptual summary of changes made
    - Focus on the "what" and "why" rather than technical implementation details
    - Save this summary as `implementation_summary.md` in the same directory as the task file
    - This serves as a memory blueprint for future development cycles
- Store task-related documentation (`execution_plan.md`, `implementation_summary.md`) alongside task files
