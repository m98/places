## What & Why
- **Feature/Task:** Complete UX redesign of the collaborative canvas game at /play to create an engaging, polished gaming experience
- **Problem/Goal:** Current game lacks visual appeal and "wow factor" with poor UX elements: generic header text, confusing paint/timing indicators, difficult color selection, inconsistent grid spacing, and uneven cursor highlighting. Goal is to transform it into a visually stunning, intuitive game interface.
- **In scope:** Header redesign with engaging branding, intuitive paint/timing UI components, improved color palette and selection UX, fixed grid spacing and cursor highlighting, icon integration, canvas size evaluation (consider 45x45 vs current 15x15), overall visual polish and game-like aesthetics
- **Out of scope:** Core game mechanics/logic changes, backend functionality, multiplayer features, performance optimizations unrelated to UX

## Interfaces & Dependencies
- **APIs / schemas / migrations:** No changes expected - purely frontend UX improvements
- **Env/Secrets/Flags:** None identified for this UX redesign
- Packages to install: Icon library (e.g., react-icons, lucide-react), potentially additional UI libraries for enhanced visual effects

## Success Criteria (Definition of Done)
- [x] User can immediately understand the game concept from an engaging, branded header
- [x] User can select colors intuitively with improved color picker UX
- [x] User can see paint remaining and timing information in a clear, game-like interface
- [x] User can navigate the canvas with consistent grid spacing and proper cursor highlighting
- [x] Meets metrics: Enhanced visual appeal with "wow factor", improved color selection ease, more intuitive overall interface, polished game-like aesthetics

## Acceptance Tests (examples)
- **Case 1:** Given a new user visits /play, When they land on the page, Then they should immediately understand it's a collaborative painting game with engaging branding and clear visual hierarchy
- **Case 2:** Given a user wants to select a color, When they interact with the color picker, Then color selection should be intuitive and visually satisfying
- **Case 3:** Given a user is painting on the canvas, When they hover over grid squares, Then cursor highlighting should be consistent and visually appealing across all squares
- **Edge cases:** Paint timer at zero, rapid color switching, canvas interactions on mobile devices, large canvas size (45x45) performance
- **Negative cases:** No confusing UI elements, no visual inconsistencies in grid spacing, no unclear game status indicators

## Examples to Imitate
- Modern pixel art games with polished UI (clean, engaging interfaces)
- Collaborative canvas games like r/place for inspiration on grid-based painting
- Game interfaces with strong visual hierarchy and gamification elements
- Professional color picker designs from design tools (intuitive selection UX)

## Documentation to Use
- Local links: Scan existing codebase to understand current patterns and structure
- Notes (sections to follow): Use best practices for modern game UI/UX design, leverage existing Next.js/React patterns in the project

## Other Considerations
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for the improved UX
- Maintain performance with larger canvas size (45x45)
- Follow existing project TypeScript and Next.js patterns
- Add gamification elements that enhance engagement without overwhelming the interface

## Always Remember
- **Document changes** - After successful verification:
    - Write a brief, conceptual summary of changes made
    - Focus on the "what" and "why" rather than technical implementation details
    - Save this summary as `implementation_summary.md` in the same directory as the task file
    - This serves as a memory blueprint for future development cycles
- Store task-related documentation (`execution_plan.md`, `implementation_summary.md`) alongside task files
